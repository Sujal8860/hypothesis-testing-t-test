# hypothesis-testing-t-test
Welcome to the Hypothesis Testing with T-Test Examples repository! This project provides practical Python examples demonstrating how to perform various T-Tests for statistical hypothesis testing. Whether you're verifying quality control claims, comparing team productivity, or assessing the impact of training programs, these examples offer a step-by-step guide to making data-driven decisions.
Project Overview

Statistical hypothesis testing is crucial for validating assumptions and making informed decisions. In this repository, you'll explore:

One-Tailed T-Test: Test if a product’s weight is lower than the claimed value.

Two-Tailed T-Test: Compare productivity between two teams.

Paired T-Test: Evaluate the effectiveness of a training program by comparing pre- and post-training performance.
Detailed Examples

Example 1: Validating whether the average weight of a product meets the manufacturer’s claim.

Example 2: Analyzing the difference in productivity scores between two teams.

Example 3: Assessing the impact of a training program on employee performance through paired testing.

Contributions are highly encouraged! If you have suggestions, improvements, or additional examples, please fork the repository and submit a pull request. For issues or questions, feel free to open an issue.
Happy testing and may your data always guide you to the right decision!
